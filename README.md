## About the Video Course
Java Enterprise isn’t one of the easiest platforms to work with, especially when it comes with a number of different confusing paradigms and jargon – JDBC, JTA, JAX, MVC, Hibernate, and so on, to name a few. Add other technologies such as MySQL and Struts, and you’re bound to leave someone more confused than when they started. Common courses often leave the user with the basics, such as creating a simple application and you are okay. You can follow along with the instructor and finish the project and then replicate it, but the moment you are asked to modify the application for real-world use you won’t know what to do. How do you fix the errors or even know what the pop up error means? This is why we have designed this comprehensive course. The main aim of this Java EE tutorial is to help you gain real-world practical application knowledge of Java Enterprise. This course will show you exactly how to deviate from the theory to actually learning how to start building your own applications. Using a project-based approach, you’ll not only follow the instructor, but you’ll also learn why and how, in addition to simply what. Before we delve into the course details further, let’s take a quick look at what Java Enterprise actually is. Java Enterprise is a set of specifications that extend the Java SE platform and allow developers to build scalable applications that can handle transactions, security, concurrency, and so on.
